# Marchant Web '23

![Homepage Screenshot](public/cover.jpg)

This repo contains the latest code for [MarchantWeb.com](https://marchantweb.com). It's a Nuxt 3 project that centers around a WebGL visualization that ebs and flows into each page.

I've made the code open-source, with the obvious caveat that it's meant to act as a reference for learning and developing your own creative website, and that you cannot clone it and pretend to be me.

For the sake of security, the connection to Notion's API is abstracted behind a service at `api.marchantweb.com`, which is not open-source. You won't find any secret keys here.
